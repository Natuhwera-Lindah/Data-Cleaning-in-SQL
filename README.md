# Data-Cleaning-in-SQL
In this project, I conducted data cleaning using the Nashville Housing dataset, aiming to ensure data accuracy and reliability for subsequent analysis and decision-making.

Using SQL I performed data cleaning that includes;
Data standardization, Correcting inconsistent or incorrect data, Removing duplicates and deleting unused columns (CONVERT, SUBSTRING, CHARINDEX, etc)
